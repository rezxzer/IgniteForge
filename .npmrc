# pnpm configuration
# Allow build scripts for required packages
# These packages need build scripts for Next.js to work properly:
# - @parcel/watcher (file watcher)
# - @swc/core (SWC compiler)
# - sharp (image optimization)
# - unrs-resolver (resolver)

# Note: This warning is informational and can be safely ignored.
# Next.js will work fine without these build scripts, but they may improve performance.
# To approve build scripts interactively, run: pnpm approve-builds
